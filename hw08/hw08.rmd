## Homework 8

#### Due Tuesday, November 16, 11:59 PM CT

Problems 1-3 are based on the random variable $X \sim \text{Binomial}(60, 0.4)$.

### Problem 1

### A

Calculate and report the mean and standard deviation of the distribution.

```{r}
n = 60
p = 0.4
mean = n * p
stdev = sqrt(n * p * (1-p))
mean 
stdev
```

-The mean of a binomial distribution of n = 60 and p = 0.4 is 24. The standard deviation would be about 3.795.

### B

Calculate and report $\prob(X = 25)$

```{r}
dbinom(25, 60, 0.4)
```

The probability of exactly 25 successes in a binomial distribution (60, 0.4) is around 10 percent. 

### C

Calculate and report $\prob(X >= 25)$

```{r}
1 - pbinom(25, 60, 0.4)
```

The probability of at least 25 successes in a binomial distribution (60, 0.4) is about 34.4 percent. 

### D

Create a graph which displays the binomial distribution with bars for $x \ge 25$ colored in a different color from the rest to help visualize your answer to **C**.

```{r}
gbinom(60, 0.4, scale=TRUE) +
  geom_binom_density(60, 0.4, a = NULL, b = NULL, color = "gray") +
  geom_binom_density(60, 0.4, a = 25, b = NULL, color = "red")
```

### Problem 2

What is the probability that $X$ is within one, two, and three standard deviations of the mean? Round each probability to four decimal places.

```{r}
round(pbinom(mean + (c(1,2,3) * stdev), 60, 0.4) - pbinom(mean - (c(1,2,3) * stdev), 60, 0.4), 4)
```


### Problem 3

Draw a graph of this binomial distribution with vertical lines with different line types at the end points of the intervals 1, 2, and 3 sigma from the mean.

- solid for $\mu \pm \sigma$
- dashed for $\mu \pm 2\sigma$
- dotted for $\mu \pm 3\sigma$

```{r}
gbinom(60, 0.4, scale=TRUE) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean + c(-1,1)*stdev,
             color = "red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean + c(-2,2)*stdev,
             color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean + c(-3,3)*stdev,
             color = "red", linetype = "dotted")
```

### Problem 4

### A

Create a tibble where each row corresponds to a binomial distribution with the following columns:

- `n` for $n = 1000,1001, \ldots, 10,000$
- `p` equal to 0.9 for each row
- `mu` equal to the mean
- `sigma` equal to the standard deviation
- `q.975` equal to the 0.975 quantile of the distribution
- `z = (q.975 - mu)/sigma`, the standardized z-score of the quantile
- `prob` equal to $\prob(X \ge q.975)$, a right-tail probability for the distribution in each row

Display all columns and the rows of this table for which $n$ is a multiple of 1000.

```{r}
prob4 = tibble(
  n = seq(1000, 10000),
  p = 0.9,
  mu = n * p,
  sigma = sqrt(n * p * (1-p)),
  `q.975` = qbinom(0.975, n, p),
  z = (`q.975` - mu) / sigma,
  prob = 1 - pbinom(`q.975`, n, p)
)
prob4 %>%
  filter(n %% 1000 == 0)
```

### B

Use a line plot to show the relationship between $n$ on the x axis and $z$ on the y axis.
Add a smooth curve to highlight the trend.
Describe the pattern you see.

```{r}
prob4 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n, y=z)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth()
```

Of binomial distributions with the same probability, it appears that the z-scores of the 97.5th percentile gradually increase as n increases, although the rate at which the z-scores increase is continually decreasing. Meaning, up to a point (around 5000 in this case) the distribution of z-scores follow a radical trend whereas past that point it is fairly linear and constant.

### C

What is the average of the values of $z$ for $n > 9000$?

```{r}
prob4 %>%
  filter(n > 9000) %>%
  summarize(mean(z))
```

### D

Plot the right tail probability `prob` on y axis versus `n` on the x axis.

```{r}
prob4 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=n, y=prob)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth()
```

### E

What is the average of the values of `prob` for $n > 9000$?

```{r}
prob4 %>%
  filter(n > 9000) %>%
  summarize(mean(prob))
```

### Problem 5

### A

What is the 0.975 quantile of the standard normal distribution?

```{r}
qnorm(0.975)
```

### B

What is the area to the right of this quantile?

```{r}
1 - pnorm(qnorm(0.975))
```

### Problem 6

For the $\text{N}(500,100)$ distribution, find values $a$ and $b$ such that $a < b$, the area between $a$ and $b$ under the normal density is equal to 0.6,
and $a$ and $b$ are equally distant from $\mu = 500$.

```{r}
a = qnorm(0.2, 500, 100)
b = qnorm(0.8, 500, 100)
pnorm(b, 500, 100) - pnorm(a, 500, 100)
500 - a
b - 500
paste("a:", a, "b:", b)
```


### Problem 7

Graph the $\text{N}(500,100)$ distribution and shade the area between $a$ and $b$ from the previous problem.

```{r}
gnorm(500, 100) +
  geom_norm_fill(mu=500, sigma=100, a=a, b=b)
```
